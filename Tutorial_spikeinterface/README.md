# SpikeInterface DEMO v0.98 - Neuralnet Marseille - October 2023


In this demo, you will use SpikeInterface to analyze a dataset recordinded with cambridge neurotec probe.

The objective of this demo is to show all the functionalities of SpikeInterface on a real-world example.

This dataset is nicely provided by Eduarda Centeno, Arthur Leblois and Aude Retailleau from IMN lab in Bordeaux.
It is a recording from a zebra finch for testing the probe ASSY-236-H5 from cambridge neurotech.
The recording system is the open-ephys usb3 board.
This file is only for testing or teaching purposes.

We recommend creating a new `si_env` conda environment using:

`conda env create -f environment.yml`




In addition, it is recommended to install [docker-desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/), as this will enable us to run 
multiple spike sorters without installation!
